PhysioCare is a simulation system designed to model physiotherapy processes, monitor patient metrics, and provide interactive visualizations for rehabilitation and medical training.

---

## Features

- Simulation of patient physiotherapy routines and movements  
- Real-time monitoring of metrics (e.g., joint angles, force, range of motion)  
- Visual feedback and graphs for performance over time  
- Configurable scenarios (e.g., different exercises, difficulty levels)  
- Save and load simulation sessions  
- Modular architecture for adding new physiotherapy modules
