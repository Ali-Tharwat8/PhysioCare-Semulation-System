## üöÄ Features

- Simulate physiotherapy routines & exercises  
- Visual feedback of motion, joint angles, and trajectories  
- Real-time monitoring of performance metrics  
- Multiple scenario configurations (e.g. different movement types, difficulty levels)  
- Save & load sessions for repeatability & analysis  
- Modular architecture for extending new exercise modules & metrics  

---
## üõ† Requirements & Dependencies

- C++ (version 11 or newer) or relevant compiled language  
- Graphics / UI library (e.g. Qt, SFML, or similar)  
- Math / physics library (for kinematics, dynamics)  
- Standard I/O libraries  
- Platform support: Windows, Linux, or macOS (depending on target)
